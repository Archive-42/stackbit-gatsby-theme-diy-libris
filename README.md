# ✨ Stackbit DIY + Libris (docs) themes combined for Gatsbyjs ✨

<img src="https://themes.stackbit.com/images/diy-demo-1024x768.png" width="600">

This is a [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com) site using Git as a [CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system). It was created with [Stackbit](https://www.stackbit.com?utm_source=project-readme&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=user_themes) in under a minute.

It combines the [DIY theme](https://github.com/stackbithq/stackbit-theme-diy), which provides more extensive customization than other themes, and detailed blog posts with tags, categories, author and frontmatter image positioning, with the [Libris theme](https://github.com/stackbithq/stackbit-theme-libris)'s docs section, providing a MDX-based documentation that can also be edited in Stackbit Studio's visual editor.

You can create a site on Stackbit and import this repository to kickstart your own showcase+documentation website.
